# Database Connection

Kemal supports database connection in an easy and extensible way. Kemal uses
a connection pool to handle all the connections meaning it's scalable by default.

Currently Kemal supports Postgresql and MySQL with:

- [kemal-pg](https://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal-pg)
- [kemal-mysql](https://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal-mysql)
