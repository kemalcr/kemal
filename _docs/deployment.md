## Heroku

You can use [heroku-buildpack-crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/heroku-buildpack-crystal) to deploy your Kemal application to Heroku.

## Cross-compilation

You can cross-compile a Kemal app by using this [guide](http://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/cross-compilation.html).

P.S: Crystal supports only OS X and Linux for now.
