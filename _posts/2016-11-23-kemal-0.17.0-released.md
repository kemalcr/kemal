Hello everyone,

Kemal 0.17.0 is here! It's the most complete and polished release yet with lots of goodies. This release also adds support for the awesome [Crystal 0.20.0 release](https://crystal-lang.org/2016/11/22/crystal-0.20.0-released.html).

## Better Middleware / Filter Routing

Now all requests will first go through the Middleware stack then Filters (before_* / after_*) and will finally reach the matching route.

Which is illustrated as,

```
Request -> Middleware -> Filter -> Route
```

Let's take a look at an example. Be aware that all custom handlers have to inherit from `Kemal::Handler`.


```ruby
class MyCustomHandler < Kemal::Handler
  def call(env)
    puts "You shall pass me first!"
    call_next(env)
  end
end

before_get "/" do
  puts "This will work before get"
end

get "/" do
  puts "Hello Kemal!"
end

add_handler MyCustomHandler.new
```

Now what's the output of this? Before Kemal `0.17.0`

```
This will work before get
You shall pass me first!
Hello Kemal
```

As you can easily see before `0.17.0` handlers worked after the filters. After `0.17.0` it will work as expected

```
You shall pass me first!
This will work before get
Hello Kemal
```

Neat!

## Only / Exclude for Handlers

Now that the lifecycle of a request / response starts from a `Handler` it'd be great to have a handler work for specified routes.

That's where `only/exclude` comes to play.

Consider that we have a handler like this which will on run for `/` path.

```ruby
class OnlyHandler < Kemal::Handler
  only ["/"]

  def call(env)
    return call_next(env) unless only_match?(env)
    puts "If the path is / i will be doing some processing here."
  end
end
```

Here's 2 points to catch.

- You define which routes the handler will run with `only ["/"]`.
- You check if the route is a `only` registered with `only_match?(env)`.

Here's also a sample for `exclude`

```ruby
class ExcludeHandler < Kemal::Handler
  exclude ["/"]

  def call(env)
    return call_next(env) unless only_match?(env)
    puts "If the path is NOT / i will be doing some processing here."
  end
end
```

Simple enough!

## Better Custom Error Handling

`error` handler now also yields error. For example you can get the error mesasage like

```ruby
error 500 do |env, err|
  err.message
end
```
